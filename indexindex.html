    <p class="def">Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.[1] In
    classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually
    consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is
    considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues
    between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual
    framework.
    
    Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises
    like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in the
    Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place), or in the later "geometrical conception
    of place" as "space qua extension" in the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath
    Alhazen.[2] Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in
    the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics. In Isaac Newton's view, space was
    absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in the space.[3]
    Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations
    between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and
    theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the "visibility of spatial depth" in his Essay Towards a New Theory of
    Vision. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived
    from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and
    use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of "space" in his Critique of Pure Reason as being a
    subjective "pure a priori form of intuition".
    
    In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is
    conceived as curved, rather than flat. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around
    gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.[4] Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that
    non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.</p>

    <p class="p1">Following Galileo and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the philosophy of space and time revolved around the
    ideas of Gottfried Leibniz, a German philosopher–mathematician, and Isaac Newton, who set out two opposing theories of
    what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that
    space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: "space is that which results
    from places taken together".[10] Unoccupied regions are those that could have objects in them, and thus spatial
    relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual
    entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete.[11] Space could be
    thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one
    another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.[12] Leibniz argued that space could not exist
    independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for
    the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these
    universes apart then, according to the identity of indiscernibles, there would be no real difference between them.
    According to the principle of sufficient reason, any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible
    universes must therefore be wrong.<br><br>Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and
    experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels
    with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements
    are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces, it
    must be absolute.[14] He used the example of water in a spinning bucket to demonstrate his argument. Water in a bucket
    is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the
    surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket's spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave
    as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the
    bucket and the water.[15] Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself.
    For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of
    matter.</p>
